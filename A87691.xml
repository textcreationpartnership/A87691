            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I mistake not, the Kentish-men were up in Rebellion before you went last from hence, and therefore you may expect to be advertised of the issue and event of that businesse, six or eight thousand of those Rebels were imbodied upon Black-Hearth, which is within two or three miles of <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> (for <hi>Kent</hi> is commonly said to be out of <hi>Christendome,)</hi> and certainly if they had been good Christians, they would never have had thoughts of such a Diabolicall attempt; many of them were well armed, and good Horse as well as Foote among them, and two small Field-Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were mounted in <hi>Debtford,</hi> where their Head-Quarters were for one or two nights, the Generall sent a Party of Horse under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonel <hi>Whaley,</hi> upon whose Alarm and approach the enemy removed from <hi>Debtford,</hi> Black-Hearth and <hi>Greenwich,</hi> (leaving there two Field-Peeces behind them,) unto <hi>Dartford,</hi> and from thence were chased to <hi>Rochester,</hi> many of them being taken prisoners and slaine in the flight, and the Major of that place in safe Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161813:2"/> that City being also ingaged, and now redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Our Forces compassed the Countrey, where the Rivers were most fordable, and other passes most accessable, (for the enemy had used much skil in obstructing many of the nearest passages) at last our Forces encountred them again at <hi>Maidston,</hi> a chiefe Towne in that County, where they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted their entrance with the enemy, in a very fierce and hot manner, for the greatest part of one very wet night, killing many, and taking many prisoners; at last they all dispersed and fled away, leaving their Armes and Horses, and our Forces to be Masters of the Town.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This place and that part of the County so set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Generall marched to <hi>Canterbury,</hi> where two or three thousand more of the Kentishmen and Inhabitants, had put themselves in a warlike posture against the Parliaments Forces. Within some few dayes by the wisedome and valour of the Generall and his Army, <hi>Canterbury</hi> was taken in upon mercifull Articles assented to and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by his Excellency: whilst these things were acting, the enemy had besieged <hi>Dover-Castle,</hi> and possessed themselves of two or three other little
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:161813:3"/> Castles, not far from that, the General sent a party to relieve the same, and it is effectually performed, so that this County is in a manner totally reduced, only the small Castles before mentioned, stand out, and are beleagured by so considerable a party, as (by Gods blessing) there will be a good and speedy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof: In this action, most of the chiefest of the Gentlemen of the County were ingaged, many of them with 13. or 1400. more were taken Prisoners, and 200. at the least slaine, and great store of Horses Armes and Ammunition taken. At the first appearance of this Action, there were some contest amongst the Gentlemen, who should be their Generall or Commander in chiefe of their Forces, at last they pitcht upon one Esquire <hi>Hales,</hi> (a bird that hath good feathers to pluck) and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen of the County had their parts in this insurrection, as Colonels, Lieutenant Colonels, Majors, Captains, &amp;c. but their splendor continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a short time, for the sudden appearance of the super-annuated Lord <hi>Goring</hi> eclipsed their lustre, the supream Command being devolved on him, which he manfully maintained till he was well beaten out of the County, and forced to take soyle like a hurt Deer; At the Isle of <hi>Dogges,</hi> he lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as many as he could get to runne away with him, but some was so hasty to follow their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:161813:3"/> Leader, that <hi>Charon</hi> mistaking the landing place, (being a dark night) wafted them over into the land of darknesse, saw them rebaptized in <hi>Thamisis,</hi> and there left them to feast the Inhabitants of that Elementary Region, and there I also leave them till the Resurrection, and by that time they may be changed into Sharks, or Cod-fishes, to be served up at <hi>Pluto's</hi> Table, when he invites their <hi>Generalissimo</hi> to dinner. This Lord is called the Earle of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and from hence some conceit that his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet spirit had a <hi>Transmigration</hi> into the Butchers of <hi>Norwich,</hi> which occasioned the late Tumult there; It had been well for these Counties of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Essex</hi> if this their Earle had been then amongst some of those brutish Cut-throats, though I think he had no hand in the Papists Powder-Plot: This great Generall with his flying Army hath now put himselfe amongst a herd of <hi>Essex</hi> Claves, and hath been so closely hunted by the Generals Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, (who had the scent of them at least a mile off,) that at the first onset, he and his Beasts of prey quitted Bow-Bridg with the losse of some men, the taking of some Prisoners, and relmquishing two great Peeces planted upon the said Bridg; With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further dispute (not daring to make a Halt at <hi>Burnt-wood</hi> as being too hot for them,) they made a running retreat to <hi>Chelmesford,</hi> hoping to do
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161813:4"/> wonders by the helpe of the Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> his plundered Armory.) The fortunate and valiant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall with a considerable number of his Forces are in hot pursuit of them, not doubting but by Gods assistance his Excellencies Sword will overtake those unnaturall blood-suckers, whose grand designe hath been to imbark this kingdom in a second bloody War from which the Lord deliver us. Some of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Commons, and others of the Committee of that County, these besotted <hi>Essexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have taken prisoners, set a guard upon them, and use them very harshly, as is said; but the House of Commons have given directions to their noble <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> that if any force shall be offered to the said Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen by the enemy, that then he shall give no quarter to any of them.</p>
            <p>Our best intelligence assures us, that <hi>Goring</hi> and his dampned crew for their plundring and outragious deportments, are deserted by multitudes of the <hi>Essex</hi> men, and thousands risen up against them, crying unanimously, <hi>We are deceived, we are deceived;</hi> and so indeed they are, rendring themselves by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate ingaging with them (and that upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and distinct interests, as witlesse as their Country man <hi>Walthams</hi>-Calfe, <hi>that went 9 miles to suck a Bull.</hi> How unhappy are these men that have not grace to acquiesse in the mercy of God who preserved them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:161813:4"/> all this while from plunderings and many other mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which other Counties have groaned under, and now at the last they have called in the roaring <hi>Gorin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> to dispoyle them of all their wealth and riches that the sufferings of many wasted Counties did transferre to them; Oh ye brainsick Bleaters, <hi>Who hath bewitched you?</hi> The rest of the infatuated <hi>White Faces</hi> of that County (who yet stand to it as if they resolved to inforce their own destruction) have now chosen one Sir <hi>Charles Lucas</hi> (a younger Brother of <note place="margin">Lucus.</note>
               <hi>England)</hi> to be their Generall, and its very probable that in a very short time he will lose himselfe and all his Desperadoes in a wood, and the Generals <hi>Mirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons</hi> will hew them down Pell-mell with their <hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boe's,</hi> whoe's the Asse then Sir, who?</p>
            <p>This day about noone one Colonel <hi>Humphreyes</hi> brought intelligence to the House of Commons, that his Excellency and the Enemy were engaged yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day about three or foure a clock in the afternoone, that <hi>Goring</hi> and his Hell-hounds, were then impoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Colchester,</hi> the Generall then preparing to storme that Towne; No Replevin will lye in this case, and therefore those Rebels must now stand to the judgement of the Sword, the justice whereof, I hope we shall heare of before to morrow night.</p>
            <p>By my next I hope to acquaint you that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:161813:5"/> of this county are well allayed and setled, as those of <hi>Kent,</hi> In the interim, let this Narrative suffice to raise up your Spirits, and confirm you in aconstant dependancy upon the Lord of Hosts, who fights the battailes of his servants, but beware of relying too much upon an Arme of flesh, give all the glory to God, and on him cast all your confidence; I shall insist no further but subscribe,</p>
